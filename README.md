# subcrit_reactor_neutron_flow

Click [this](https://github.com/FermiParadox/subcrit_reactor_n_flow/blob/master/neutron_flux.ipynb). Github will take care of the rest. 

My main goal in this "project" is familiarizing myself with IPython, Sympy, Numpy, etc. 
There might be errors since I didn't check it thoroughly.  

Also, the experimental data were rather problematic, since the fuel rods were not available
during the experiment. Indium was activated with neutrons from the <sup>241</sup>AmBe source only.
