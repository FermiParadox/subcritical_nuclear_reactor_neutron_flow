# Subcritical reactor neutron flow

Analysis of the experimental results of the neutron flow in a subcritical nuclear reactor.  

[Click](https://github.com/FermiParadox/subcrit_reactor_n_flow/blob/master/neutron_flux.ipynb) to have Github render it. 

### Disclaimer
My main goal in this "project" is familiarizing myself with IPython, Sympy, Numpy, etc. 
There might be errors since I didn't check it thoroughly.  

Also, the experiment was rather problematic, since the fuel rods were not available during the experiment. Indium was activated with neutrons from the <sup>241</sup>AmBe source only.
